    <h1>Knowledge System Operations Manual</h1>
    <div class="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This manual defines operational procedures for a local-first knowledge system. It covers ingestion, indexing, retrieval, synthesis, and audit workflows. The objective is to ensure reliability, traceability, and maintainability across routine and high-load usage scenarios.</p>
      <p>Operators should follow the sequence in this document and record deviations in run logs. Every process step assumes explicit source tracking and verifiable outcomes to reduce ambiguity during incident review.</p>
