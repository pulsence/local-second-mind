# Contributing to Local Second Mind

Thank you for your interest in Local Second Mind!

## Pull Requests

This project **does not accept Pull Requests**. Local Second Mind is a personal project built in my spare time, largely with the help of AI tooling. I do not have the bandwidth to review and merge external PRs.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to help, the best way is to **submit an issue** on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/pulsence/local-second-mind/issues).

### Bug Reports

When reporting a bug, please include:

- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Stacktrace or log output** (as much as possible)
- **Relevant config snippets** (redact any API keys or sensitive values)
- **Environment details** (OS, Python version)

### Feature Requests

When requesting a feature, please include:

- **Description** of the feature
- **What it would do** — expected behavior and usage
- **Why it would improve the project** — the problem it solves or the value it adds

## What Happens Next

I will review submitted issues and assess how to handle them on my own schedule. There are no guarantees on timeline, but well-written issues with clear reproduction steps or strong rationale are much more likely to be acted on.
