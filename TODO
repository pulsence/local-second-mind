# Todo

## Current Items
### LLM Providers
- There should be a basic method that simply handles sending messages and receiving message with the
  llm and all other methods (e.g., synthesize, rerank, etc.) all use that base method basic calling,
  streaming, cached server, etc. The highlevel methods should only can about formating the request
  or handling the response.

### Agent
- Look at the files in .claude_files/sandbox_plan to generate a complete development for a
  sandbox to run agents in. These plans are to be treated as guidelines since they were created
  without reference to the actual code. As you develop the plan make sure to update them to the
  style and structure of the actual code base.
    - Be sure to clearly document the threat model and security model in docs/ and follow the
      security test plan. We need to make sure that we try to break the sandbox in the test suite.
- Create a simple agent where the user gives a task and the agent processes it via the background.
- Read .claude_files/lsm_agent_roadmap_writing_synthesis_curator.md for an outline of new agents
  and tools to create. The ideas in this file should be included when creating the next plan and
  adapted to the style and struture of the actual code base.
- Read .claude_files/lsm_agent_advanced_capabilities_plan.md for an outline of new capabilites for
  the agent system. The ideas in this file should be included when creating the next plan and
  adapted to the style and struture of the actual code base.

### Testing
- Make sure that there are tests which interact with web services have a test that actaully
  makes web calls. This includes LLM API calls.
- Make sure that there are tests which read and write from file peform actual filesystem operations.
- Make sure that there are DB tests and embedding tests that make actual DB and embedding calls.
- There should be a full intergration test that create an actual DB, embeddes actual files,
  and queries using actual Remote Providers against a live LLM provider.
    - The test file fixtures should be improved to ensure that there is enough data to properly
      run this suite.
- The test suite should be able to run a series of smoke tests which do not hit live servies
  and only at specific times should the entery test suite on live services be used.
- User should be able to set a custom config for the test suite.
- There should be NO STUBS or MOCK tests.

## Future Items (INGORE ALL THE FOLLOWING FOR PLANNING)
### Code Quality
- Do a checking for large files that could be refactored into small files.
- Check overly complicated code paths or redundant code.
- Look for places where code is duplicated and can be consolidated.
- Look for any legacy code, dead code, or backwards compatability code and remove it.
- Look for places where module boundaries are not properly respected and abstractions
  have started to leak and reinforce module boundaries and consider refactoring if
  abstractions have become too leaky.
- Check Tests to make sure there is not artifical duplication.

### Deployment
- Create clear install instructions
- Explore creating docker images

### Ingest
- Need to consider when a heading has sub headings, they can be included and explore what if
  heading groups are particular small and so produce the situation where overlaps include whole
  other chunks.

### MCP Services
- Add abilities to ingest MCPs
- Add Agent tool to handle MCPs in Agents. 

### Future Source Providers
- Create OpenAlex - Crossref - Unpaywall - CORE pipeline to find, download, and ingest documents
- Archive.org
- Look into AI Providers Web Search API as alts to Brave
- Perseus CTS API
- Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) API
- Library of Congress (loc.gov) JSON/YAML API
- Smithsonian Open Access API
- The Met Collection API (Open Access)
- Rijksmuseum data services
- IIIF APIs (Image / Presentation / Content Search
- Wikidata SPARQL endpoint
- PubMed/PubMed Central
- SSRN (Social Science Research Network)
- PhilArchive
- Project MUSE (humanities)
- News Sources: NYTimes, et al.
- Social Media: Twitter, et al.
- Finantial Sources
    - Market data
    - Federal/Government API data
