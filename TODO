# Todo (Future Timeline of Work)

**The curren plan is for version [0.7.1](.agents/docs/PLAN.md).**

## v0.7.2: Per Agent Refinement
### User Defined Agents
- User should be able to configure a "custom" agent which where they specify which
  agent they are adjusting and then defines the name, category, opening prompt, and
  the tools and folders available to the agent. This agent should then appear in
  the TUI screen.

### Research Agent
- Need to add greater exploration in each phase to bring in a diversity of sources.
- Need to clarify the role of the other Academic agents

### Document Analysis Agent
- Given a document does a deep dive analysis following
  footnotes, comparing with other documents, exploring
  origins of ideas, etc.

### News Assistant Agent
- Should not just read and combine, but use and llm to create
  summary digests of the latest news.

### Agent Assistant
- Should use LLM to create summary digest of statistics of
  findings

### Calendar Assistant
- Should use LLM to create digest of upcoming events

### Email Assistant
- Should use LLM to create summaries digests of recent emails
- Have the ability to draft responses to particular emails

### General Meta Agent
- Like General Agent, but can spawn General Agents

## v0.8.0: Embedding Retrevial Improvments

### DB
- Add DB versioning with migratin/upgrade between versions.
  - This needs to be thoroughly tested.
- Add DB complete, meaning when an update adds new ingest etc. items stored
  there should be a way for the DB to be completed with this new data instead
  of having to rebuild the entire DB

### Architecural Overhall

- Read .claude_files/INGEST_FUTURE.md for an outline of how to create
  a plan to improve the ingest and embedding retrevial pipeline.

### Document Headings Improvement

- When a text document has subheadings the user should be able to define
  how many subheadings deep should be considered when creating chunk
  boundaries by headings. Otherwise the ingest should intellegently use
  subheadings based upon the follow criteria:
  - When a heading is larger than the max chunk size and contains
      sub-headings,
      then the section should be chunked along the sub-heading boundaries. The meta-data
      in the chunk should indicate the heirarchy of headings: heading::sub-heading
  - This process should repeat into nested subheadings so long as the
      current heading level is larger than the target max chunk size.

## v0.9.0: Refactor and Dog Food

### General

- Update "psycopg[binary]>=3.1", "pgvector>=0.4",

### Documentation

- Improve documentation
- Find a way to automatically turn the documentation into a viewable site
  using MkDocs and GitHub actions to deploy to a GitHub Pages.
- Ensure that every sentence gramatically follows.
- Ensure that the config document explains all possible configuration
  settings.
  - Note that it can treat tools and agents in general. Each tool and agent
    should clearly document their configuration settings.

### Code Quality

- Do a checking for large files that could be refactored into small files.
- Check overly complicated code paths or redundant code.
- Look for places where code is duplicated and can be consolidated.
- Look for any legacy code, dead code, or backwards compatability code and
  remove it.
- Look for places where module boundaries are not properly respected and
  abstractions have started to leak and reinforce module boundaries and
  consider refactoring if abstractions have become too leaky.
- Check Tests to make sure there is no artifical duplication.
- Review for any legacy/backwards-capatability/dead-code and review it.
- Remove Azure AI provider. OpenRouter will be the go to endpoint for sources
  beyond OpenAI/Anthropic/Google.
- Search for feature creep or bloat.
- Update Config search path to start by searching in <GLOBAL_FOLDER> and 
  load env files from there

### Deployment

- Create clear install instructions
- Explore creating docker images
- Config pyproject to install complete/just chroma/just pgsql

### Testing

- Ensure that the complete security strategy in SECURITY.md is being
  followed. Pay particular attention to the testing of the Meta agent to
  make sure that it is thoroughly tested.
  - The security tests of the whole agent system should test every way to
      break out of the sandbox.
- Review the test suite to make sure that live services are tested and there
  are no stubs or "auto-pass" tests.
- Ensure that the test suite is properly structured to match the actual
  project module structure and the tests are properly named.
- Ensure that there are full integration tests uses the different
  configurations to make sure that the different AI Providers, DBs, etc.
  work with each other.
- Make sure that different DB migration tests truly load complete DBs and
  successfully migrate in both directions SQLite <-> PG, and Chroma <-> PG
- Expand performance test suite beyond the TUI startup SLA
- Ensure there are PDf ingest tests and PDF OCR ingest tests

## v0.10.0: Extra Control Paths

- Add ability to send email/txt notifications
- Add ability to create RSS Feed from for example the News Agent
- Add ability to launch commands by txt/email

## v0.11.0: UI

- Add Web interface (mobile and desktop browsers)
- Add desktop UI based up web interface

## v0.12.0: Intergrations

- Add Zotero itegrations
- Complete Obsidian integration
  - Create obsidian plugin that connects to the LSM server used by the Web
    UI to allow the user to interact with LSM via the API requests
- Complete logseq integration

## v0.13.0: Internals

### Levarage DBs

- Persist ingest state and file hashes to enable incremental re-ingest and
  avoid duplicate embeddings.
- Store chunk-level metadata (doc id, offsets, tags, source path) to improve
  filters and explainability.
- Add a durable query cache with TTL cleanup (survives restarts).
- Persist run summaries, tool approvals/denials, and outcomes for
  auditability and analytics.
- Move scheduler/workflow state out of JSON into a DB for concurrency safety
  and richer queries.
- Store user feedback/annotations to improve memory promotion and retrieval
  ranking.
- Does it make sense given how large and complicated the config file is becoming
  to use SQLite for settings.

## v1.0.0: First Release

### General

- Dogfood everything again
- Check for code refactors and test usage
- Confirm installation process
- Create clear documentation/examples API/Configs with testing to track
  backwards compatability.
- Ensure the start up times are as fast as possible.
- Look for code optimization points (both in terms of memory usage and
  execution time).

### TUI

- Ensure TUI is rock solid and following the best practices

### Web

- Ensure Web interface is rock solid and following the best practices

### Remote Controlers

- Ensure Txt and Email notifications and control messanges are rock solid

## v1.1.0: Remote Access
- Provide the ability to access LSM from remote location. Since the GUI is already a front
  end for a web api backend, in theory a VPN (tailscape) onto the computer running LSM
  would be sufficient and so any plan for remote access most judged compared to that.
  - Option 1: In theory all that is need to run the system remote is access to the DB. If
    the DB is PG and remote hosted. Then there just needs to be a LSM public webserver with
    access to the remote hosted PG. The only immediate issue would be that the user would not
    be able to directly access the full files, though the DB largely already contains everything
    anyway.
  - Option 2: Create a kind of Hub, were the local LSM can register and then the Hub and LSM
    connect over an encrypted channel. Over this channel the hub makes API calls and then
    renders them normally. This basically recreates a VPN to the Local LSM that is transparent
    to the user.

## v1.2.0: Webpage Navigation

- Add ability to scrape websites.
  - Design to be flexible so as to configure "adapters" for particular websites
  - Design to use AI to adapt on the fly to changing HTML
- Add ability to login on websites.
- Add ability to create "RSS Feed" of websites, meaning periodically read
  and then create list of posts/new content.

## v.1.3.0: Drives
- Research value in integrating One Drive and Google Drive

## v1.4.0: Finantial Features

- Finance Remote Providers (See .agents/future_plans/FINANCE_PROVIDERS.md)
- Finance Agents

## v1.5.0: Social Features
- Social Remote Providers
- Social Agents

## v1.6.0: Formal Validation System
- Do research into how to add formal validation so as to
  create an agent that will be given a task and create a
  formal proof of the task.
- This agent should be intentional in building up memories
  of formal proofs to aid create foundational knowledge
